# Security-Audit


<h2>Description</h2>
I was tasked with taking a look at a fictional toy business who's online presence has recently significantly increased. Due to the increase of traffic and infulx of customers, the head of the IT department decided it was a good time to perform an internal IT audit to secure the company's infrastructure and to mitgate potential risks threats, and vulnerabilities. The goal of this audit was to provide an overview of the risk the company might experience in efforts to present an expanstion of the IT department to senior leadership. 

<h3>Attached are two documents. "Security Audit" shows the breakdown of the audit, the controls consideried, priority levels of each control, and what guidelines will keep the company in compliance. "Audit Findings" is the report to present to stakeholders regarding the audit findings and breaks down in simple tearms what should be the priority and why.</h3>
